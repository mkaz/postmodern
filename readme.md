# Postmodern WordPress Theme

This theme was created specifically for my primary photography site at [mkaz.com](https://mkaz.com/). It is a bit opinionated, and tailored specifically for my site, I need to clean it up and generalize it to some degree, but might be useful.

Please feel free to take and modify, I welcome any changes, suggestions, or improvements.

It was germinated from the starter theme [Davis](http://www.andersnoren.se/teman/davis-wordpress-theme/) by [Anders Nor√©n](http://www.andersnoren.se/). Design style inspired by Gutenberg and this [demo post](http://moc.co/sandbox/example-post/) created by [Joen](https://twitter.com/altjoen).

### Colophon

The theme uses [Noto Serif font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif) from Google fonts.

The decorative and social icons are from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
